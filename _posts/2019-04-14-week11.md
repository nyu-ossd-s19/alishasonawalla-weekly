# Team Project & Thoughts on Cathedral and the Bazaar

## Cathedral and the Bazaar

*Blog about at least two of the three lessons from The Cathedral and the Bazaar essay listed below (what do you think they mean and what do you think about them)*

#### Lesson 1: "Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away."

This lesson highlights the idea that code can never reach a state where there is nothing more to add. Any product, software, servicses, application will always have more features to add, more enhancements to make. However, a better measure of perfection in code is when it gets simpler and better. Better here can be interpreted to mean both for the developer in terms of readability, portability etc. and also for the user as fewer bugs, a better interface so on. Hence, perfect code is not a state, but rather the direction of the code. If the code is getting better and less complex it is headed in the direction of perfection. 

I definitely agree with the lesson above. And while some may use maturity of a product as implying perfection, that may not always be true. Other than a few small projects, most software is always work in progress. Hence, it is important to change the measure of perfection for code rather than make it an unattainable goal for the team. 

#### Lesson 2: "Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong."

The lesson suggests that a good solution emerges from a solid understanding of the problem. This relates to another lesson in the book: "Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow". Both the lessons seem to imply the same thing. It often takes a few iterations and possibly even an implementation to fully understand the problem at hand. Often times, a team believes they understand the problem and set out to solve it, only to realize they were solving the wrong one. 

The lesson is extremely relatable to me. I have often worked on projects and products during my internship where we set out to implement a feature only to realize that we weren't solving the right issue. That is the essence of the software development lifecycle and the iterative development approach. 

*Talk about one of the lessons from The Cathedral and the Bazaar essay that you liked the most and that resonated with you the most (why is it important to you)*

#### Lesson: If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.

The essense of this lesson is that if one is interested in a particular domain, seeks out opportunities and is passionate about the work they do, interesting problems will come to them through people and teams who notice the enthusiasm. This lesson is very similar to a few others in the essay and they all deeply resonate with me because the crux of what they intend to say is the same. The reason these lesson dovetail my thoughts is that once I realized my passion for tech and it became an integral part of my life, I developed a deep passion for it. Soon I noticed many interesting challenges I could work on through internships, conferences, personal project etc. I never find myself at a loss for interesting problems around me. A few of my friends who are also passionate about tech share the same story.
