### Projects

1. Visual Studio Code 

Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft. VS Code provides multiple extensions for making source code easier to write and integarte with version control tools. Ever since I discovered VS Code, I have been regularly using the editor to write source code. It's user-friendly interface, debugging and formatting support as well as integartion with Git has made code writing a smoother process for me. An alternative to VS Code is Sublime, which is not open source. 

2. Mozilla Firefox

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. I've been actively using Firefox as a web browser and it's simple interface has made web browsing a fun experience. An alternative to Firefox would be Chrome, which isn't open source. However, there is an open source version of Chrome - Chromium. 

3. MongoDB

MongoDB is a an open source database software that allows a user to manage data. I have used MongoDB extensively for small personal projects. However, while working in the industry during internships, I found myself using other databases such as PostgreSQL. 

4. Linux

Linux is an open source operating system. I've been using Linux for software development. Linux has helped me use functionality that other OS may not support. However, an alternative to Linux would be Windows OS or MacOS.
