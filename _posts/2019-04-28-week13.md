# Team Project Progress

This week we worked on enhancing the first version of our feature implementation. I actively interacted with the community to determine what data from the particular event needs to be displayed on the graph. I discussed another crucial aspect of the feature with the community which is how the relationship between our event data would be structured (i.e. parent-child, user-event etc.) as this would affect how the event is visually displayed. It became evident through the conversations that the feature implementation would require us to change other parts of the code as well as create a new node type. We started working on the new user node type (a class) and iterations of the event display function simultaneously. I have been working on the first iteration for the user node type and will commit it by the end of the week. 

Additionally, this week I worked on identifying more documentation-related issues that could be fixed in the code base while we continue to work on the feature enhancement. I made a pull request to update some of the design, configuration, and development documentation. The pull request was accepted by the maintainer. While working on documentation updates I noticed a broken link that pointed to a non-existent markdown file, so I filed an issue for it and also volunteered to help create the file, if needed.
