# Team Project & Thoughts on Readings

## Team Project Progress

*What have you done? What did you learn? What tasks will you be working on next week?*

This week we invested time in setting up the environment for our project and debugging errors that we encountered during the installation. We also developed an action plan on what issues we plan to tackle and how. There are three category of issues we will be working on: 

1. Documentation related errors: We identified some typos and grammatical errors in the documentation that we could help fix
2. Comments on the code: None of the code has any form of comments. We will therefore consult the community and if they agree, add comments to the code
3. Add support for .evtx logs: Because the project is relatively new, there are a lot of feature requests and improvements that can greatly impact the user base. We chose to therefore add support for evtx logs as it will be a doable feature request to accomplish within a few weeks. 

With regards to the feature request we will be working on, we have already asked the community and received approval to work on the feature. 

Beyond that, we raised an issue with the community regarding the installation steps. The community was very responsive in helping us debug errors. The error also helped us identify a few improvements that we can make to the installation guideline. 

I learnt that new projects with smaller communities can be very responsive and allow enough flexibility to new contributors to take the time to understand the code base. 

Next week we plan to spend time understanding the code base and relevant files that we will be contributing to. We will be working on a few documentation related changes and starting work on our main feature.
