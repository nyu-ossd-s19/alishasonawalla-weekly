## Extension 

### Experience of making the extension

My experience of making the memeify extension was definitely a great learning experience. Not only did I learn how to make an extension in Firefox, but because we decided to make the extension for Chrome, I learnt how to do that as well. Moreover, it was interesting to understand that extensions can easily be made for both browsers, which was somewhat an accidental discovery. Memeify was definitely not what we had initially set out to develop. In fact, our original extension idea was simpler. We had decided to simply replace a few words on a the web page with the image of pikachu. However, as we began working on the extension, various team members contributed new ideas and the extension became better than we imagined.


### Collaboration

The collaborative experience was definitely very interesting. Initially I thought we might need to meet in-person to make progress on the extension. However, we managed to work effectively, remotely. Each member of the team was very proactive in contributing ideas, reviewing PRs and making suggestions to improve the extension. It became an iterative process where each person built off what had been built. The iterative technique of the building the extension eventually made our extension better than we had imagined.
