# Open Source Project Evaluation

### Project and why I chose it

And open source project I would love to work on is Microsoft's [VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode). VSCode is a code editor with built-in debugging functionality. I have been using VSCode for a long time now and it is one of my favorite editors to work with. VSCode combines the simplicity of code writing and editing with sophisticated extensions to debug, format code and integrate with git. Because I know the product so well, I thought it might be an interesting project to contribute to. Moreover, being a regular user, I will be more invested in the project than otherwise.
