I'm a tech-enthusiast, traveler and entrepreneur.

I took a year off after high school to travel and work around India, Istanbul and Tajikistan. I enjoy building things ground-up such as coffee powered batteries and solar cookers or just messing around with my drone. I love immersing myself in the technology of the future and spent last summer working in the Valley on self-driving cars. 

### Gap year in photos

Sitting amidst a range of mountains, I found myself 2000 Kilometers away from home, in a 24-year-old country, with a culture very distinct from my own - Tajikistan.



### Self-driving cars

I spent the summer 2018 working in Silicon Valley as a Software Engineer on GM and Hondaâ€™s joint self-driving car venture, Cruise Automation. With autonomous vehicle innovation at its peak, it was an exciting time to be in the Mecca of tech.
