description:I’m Alisha Sonawalla: a tech-enthusiast, traveler and entrepreneur. I took a year off after high school to travel and work around India, Istanbul and Tajikistan. I enjoy building things ground-up and spend my time working on coffee powered batteries, solar cookers or just messing around with my drone. I love immersing myself in the technology of the future and spent last summer working in the Valley on self-driving cars.
